## 🧠 Insights and Learnings

- **Critical Features**:
  - Temporal variables such as `customer tenure` and `usage fluctuations` significantly impact churn prediction.
- **Model Accuracy**:
  - The Random Forest model achieved an **88% accuracy** in identifying customers likely to churn.
- **Business Impact**:
  - Identifying high-risk customers early can guide retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

## 📈 Suggested Next Steps

1. **Optimize Models**:
   - Perform advanced hyperparameter tuning using tools like `GridSearchCV`.
   - Experiment with gradient boosting models like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM**.
2. **Handle Data Imbalances**:
   - Address imbalanced classes using techniques such as **SMOTE** or cost-sensitive learning.
3. **Expand Use Cases**:
   - Integrate additional features from customer feedback and transaction history.
